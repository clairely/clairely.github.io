I'm a first-year PhD student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.utoronto.ca/), 
University of Toronto. My research interest is System Reliability and Log Analysis, working with 
[Prof. Ding Yuan](http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/Home.html). I got my Master's degree from [Institute of Computing 
Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Bachelor's degree from 
[Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/english/). I've been an exchange student at [City University 
of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/) for a happy 5 months.  

 
I read a lot of books in my spare time, until I got a smart phone. Last bunch of books I read were in epistemology, social psychology, logics, and complexity theory. 

I have been playing basketball frequently for over ten years. I love watching knockout games in Olympics and World Championships.
